        <b>Game Instructions:</b> Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to
        find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't
        find a pair, the first card will be flipped back with the face down. Try
        to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer
        you play. When you find a pair it will remain visible until completion
        of the game. When you find all the pairs in this memory, you win!!
